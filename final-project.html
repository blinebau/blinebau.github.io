					<hr>
					<p>This page contains a summary of my findings and information I gathered as a part of the research component of my portfolio project. As a part of the project, I conducted user research and testing through various methods introduced in my course. Each section contains a description or summaries of how conducted each process and the benfit of each to my project. For further information on each topic, you can click the images in each section to go see their cooresponding documents.</p>

						<h3>User Interviews</h3>
						<div class="doc_info user_interviews">
							<p>
								Asking questions and communicating with peers and potential users is an important part of understanding user expectations and the content to provide in your website. In my case, I interviewed other students and participants that fell into the role of potential users. I focused on asking questions that helped to understand each particpant and their opinions on different aspects of a personal portfolio. The questions helped to gather information about the participants and their aspirations, and then led into specific information about their personal expectations when viewing a portfolio.

						<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
						<div class="doc_info competitior_analysis">
							<p>
								Studying and analyzing competing websites can reveal faults in your own website, or emphasize what you have done well contrary to your competitors.
								Comptetitor analysis documents the content and features of a website while recording personal thoughts about its styling and general weaknesses. An overall anaylsis of the website considers this information and evaluates how successful it is. I evaluated the portfolios of three different software engineers to analyze the strength and weaknesses of a competitor's website. I chose these three sites because they have very different styling and the tone of how the content is presented varies wildly between them. By selecting websites with significant differences it helped me understand the variety of portfolios and improve my own.

						<h3>Featue Value Matrix</h3>
						<div class="doc_info feature_matrix">
							<p>
								Determining what features to include in your website is always a concern when considering trade-offs between the time to implement such featuers, and the value gain by including it. One of the tools available for easing this process is a value matrix of features and characteristics in which can map scores and evaluations to. The features I selected to evaluate take into consideration the feedback I received from the first iteration of my website and what I learned during my user interviews. Focusing on extending accessibility on mobile, addition of content and improving styling I evaluated a selection of five different features in my matrix.

						<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
						<div class="doc_info feature_prior">
							<p>
								The addtional features I considered for my evaluations were then prioritized by how highly I valued their implementation at the cost of technical complication or time. Prioritizing features can help to aid in development time and adding what matters first for an interface. For my research, I prioritized the features using two different models: first a linear priority model and secondly one with axis of technical effort vs. business/user value.

						<h3>User Stories</h3>
						<div class="doc_info user_stories">
							<p>
								User stories can help to provide context and better understand the different types of users of your interface. By documenting a theoretical interaction or narrative for your interface you can focus on what content or features need to be available for each type of user to 'succeed' in their story. I focused on developing stories for roles that I believed would be high propable users of my website; hiring managers/employers, other developers and mobile users.

						<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
						<div class="doc_info cog_walkthrough">
							<p>
								In order to better understand and experience how users may interact with your interface, a developer can perform a cognitive walkthrough with a qualified participant. A participant could be anyone who may be viewed as a potential user or even another developer who is preferably not biased or experienced with the interface. The developer then asks the participant to perform a series of tasks with the interface and documents the interaction while asking the participant their opinions or thought processes for each task. While performing my own walkthroughs I asked participants to perform a handful of task and wrote down an overview of their interactions while noting if they strayed from the preffered method. The main challenge of the walkthrough was turning participants comments and feedback into a substantive change or addition to my interface.

						<h3>User Test</h3>
						<div class="doc_info user_test">
							<p>
								For the actual testing part of my research I considered two type of tests: navigation and click tests. I wanted to test to see if the navigation methods I chose for my interface were effective and efficient for users to use. Also, if users were able to find the information they wanted using menus and icons I provided to better guide them in their tasks. The overall results of the test were fairly successful with a majority of the users able to complete the tasks within expectations.

						<p>
							During the proccess of my user research I have gained insight into what users expect from a personal portfolio and additions I can make to the current version of my interface. For the initial version of my interface I was satisfied with the styling and responsiveness of it, but did not realize some of the accessibility issues that arise during mobile usage. It was brought to to my attention that the navigation menu for the interface on mobile interfered with viewing content and was not properly hidden when users continue to move about the interface. This would have been frustrating for mobile users viewing my portfolio, and it would not be immediately obvious how to fix it for some users. Also, while performing the cognitive walkthroughs of my interface the issue of too much text was a repeated concern for each of the participants. Obviously, my portfolio contained a significant amount of text, and it was typically not very enjoyable to read through a wall of text, especially on a mobile platform.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							I considered some styling changes for my interface after performing competitive analysis of several different developer portfolios. I specifically noticed some portfolios would present their projects or work in a tiled design layout. Each project would have a dedicated tile image that could be interacted for further information. So, the initial presentation of each project would be purely visual with any text description hidden unless the tile was interacted with. This is a possible solution for an issue that I mentioned of accessibility on mobile platforms. While considering the different features of my interface, it helped to map out the feature value mator rix fmy interface in order to fullny cosider what the necessary additions to my interface were and the value my interface benefited from them. Furthermore, by considering the value it helped to model how  Icould priorietiz which features should be incorporated first versus how much effort it took to add them.

						<p>
							Using the prioritization models and value matrix I was able to determine specific features to incorporate into my intitial version of my portfolio. With the hope of improving my portfolio a selection of these were incorporated into my interface in time for the final version during my course work. I was able to implement a viewable/downloadable resume in pdf form on my portfolio, and I also fixed the accessbility issue with the navigation menu on mobile devices. However, I still need to incorporate a more visual layout to my portfolio that does not emphasize text as heavily. Either I will redesign the project content section to have a tile layout and trim the text into a toggleable description for each projects, or I will simply trim the text into a more readable description and move heavy description to a Readme on each project's repository.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The last main incorporation I considered during my research is a better way to visualize my proficiency in various languages or frameworks I used. I considered how I can better emphasize how I used a framework and what aspects of the framework I am familiar with. The first idea that came to mind would be a simple ratings chart or table that would show a scale of proficiency. Although, this doesn't completely explain how or why I used the language or framework in my experience, but it at least give a sense of what I am using and my comfort with it. So, in a later incorporation I will change the layout of the Skills section to a more table format with ratings, but accompanied by a brief description of what I used specficially and what project I utilized each in. I believe this addition will improve the content of the Experience section of my portfolio and better explain my skills and proficiency in them.
